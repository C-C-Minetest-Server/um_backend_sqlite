# Unified Money Backend: SQLite3

This mod is a backend of [Unified Money](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Emojiminetest/unified_money/) storing the data onto a SQLite3 database. This mod also caches the data so that the database is not queried so often.

Before using this mod, please download `lsqlite3` via Luarocks and add this mod into `secure.trusted_mod`.
